# AIris-Smart-Glasses-Solution-Challenge
AIris is an AI-powered smart glasses project designed to enhance learning through instant, distraction-free AI responses. Unlike traditional AR glasses, AIris displays information in a see-through manner, similar to Iron Man's EDITH glasses. It eliminates the need to check phones for answers, reducing distractions from social media and ads.The demo video has been uploaded in google drive, showcasing the live demo of our first prototype and future enhancement plans.
